            <P style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">The Mahindra XUV700 is a premium mid-size SUV introduced in 2021 as a successor to the XUV500. It is available in multiple variants, primarily the MX and AdrenoX (AX3, AX5, AX7, and AX7L), and comes in both 5-seater and 7-seater configurations. Built on a monocoque chassis, it offers a strong road presence with sleek styling, LED lighting, and flush door handles. Under the hood, it offers two powerful engine options: a 2.0-liter turbo-petrol engine producing 200 PS and 380 Nm of torque, and a 2.2-liter turbo-diesel engine with two states of tune—153 PS for the base model and 182 PS for higher variants. Both engines are mated to 6-speed manual or automatic transmissions, with diesel automatic variants offering all-wheel drive.

Inside, the XUV700 stands out with dual 10.25-inch displays—one for infotainment and one for the digital instrument cluster. It supports Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Alexa voice commands, and includes premium features like a Sony 3D sound system, panoramic sunroof, dual-zone climate control, and wireless charging. Top variants are equipped with Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), offering adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, autonomous emergency braking, and traffic sign recognition. It scored a 5-star rating in Global NCAP crash tests, highlighting its safety credentials.

In Hyderabad, the on-road price ranges from ₹18.2 lakh for the base petrol variant to ₹32.3 lakh for the fully loaded AX7L diesel automatic AWD. Real-world mileage varies from 6–7 km/l in city driving for the petrol automatic to 12–19 km/l for the diesel automatic. While praised for its features, comfort, and performance, some users have reported minor electronic issues and inconsistent service experiences. Overall, the XUV700 offers excellent value and modern features for buyers seeking a spacious, tech-rich SUV.
